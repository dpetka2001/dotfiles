### Stack and Heap
- **<u>Stack</u>**: The stack stores values as it gets them and removes them in the opposite order. This is called *last in, first out*. Adding data is called *pushing onto the stack* and removing data is called *popping off the stack*. All data on the stack must have a known, fixed size. If the pointer has a fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want the actual data, you must follow the pointer.
- **<u>Heap</u>**: Data with unknown or varying size (size that might change) must be stored on the heap instead. The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot on the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a pointer, which is the address of the location. This is called *allocating on the heap* and is sometimes abbreviated as just *allocating*. Pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating. 
- Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is always at the top of the stack. Allocating on the heap requires more work, because the allocator must first find a big enough space to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next allocation. Accessing data on the heap is also slower than accessing data on the stack, as you must still follow the pointer, but this time through a much larger space, which might also cause the processor to jump around a lot throughout different places of memory. 
- When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function (including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function's local variables are stored on the stack. When the function is over, these values get popped off the stack. 

### Ownership rules
- Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its *owner*.
- There can only be one owner at the time. 
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

### Variable scope
A scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid. Let's say we have a variable:
```rust
let s = "hello";
```
The variable is only valid from the point at which it is declared until the end of the current *scope*.
```rust
   {                      // s is not valid here, itâ€™s not yet declared
        let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
```

### The String Type
To illustrate the rules of ownership, we need a data type that is fairly more complex than the ones we covered until now. The types covered previously are all a known size, can be stored on the stack and popped off the stack when their scope is over, and can be quickly and trivially copied to make a new, independent instance if another part of the code needs to use the same value in a different scope. 
We'll use `String` as an example here and concentrate on the parts of `String` that relate to ownership. 
We've already seen string literals, where a string value is hardcoded into our program. String literals are convenient, but not suitable for every situation. One reason is that they are immutable. #important 
For when we don't yet know what the value of a string will be (eg user input), Rust has a second string type, `String`. This type manages data allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that is unknown to us at compile time. You can create a `String`, like so:
```rust
	let s = String::from("hello");
```
The double colon (`::`) is an operator that allows us to namespace this particular `from` function under the `String` type. This kind of string *can* be mutated:
```rust
	let mut s = String::from("hello");

    s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

    println!("{}", s); // This will print `hello, world!`
```

### Memory and allocation
With the `String` type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text, we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold the contents. This means:
- The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.
- We need a way of returning the memory to the allocator when we're done with our `String`.

The first part is done by us: when we call `String::from`, its implementation requests the memory it needs. 
The second part is a bit different. We need to pair exactly one `allocate` with exactly one `free`. 
Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope. 
```rust
 {
    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point forward

    // do stuff with s
    }                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
```
When a variable goes out of scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called `drop`, and it's where the author of `String` can put the code to return the memory. Rust automatically calls `drop` at the closing curly bracket. 
It may seem simple now, but the behavior of code can be unexpected when we want to have multiple variables use the data we've allocated on the heap. Let's explore some of these situations.

### Ways variables and data interact: Move
Multiple variable can interact with data in different ways in Rust. Example:
```rust
    let x = 5;
    let y = x;
```
What this does is: "bind the value `5` to `x`; then make a copy of the value in `x` and bind it to `y`." We now have 2 variables, both equal to `5`. This is obvious, because integers are simple values with a known, fixed size and are pushed onto the stack.
Now let's look at the `String` version:
```rust
 	let s1 = String::from("hello");
 	let s2 = s1;
```
This looks similar to the above code, so we might assume that it works the same: that is, the second line would make a copy of the value in `s1` and bind it to `s2`. But this isn't quite what happens.
This is what happens to `String` under the covers. A `String` is made up of three parts, shown on the left: a pointer to the memory that holds the contents of the string, a length and a capacity. This group of data is stored on the stack. On the right is the memory on the heap that holds the contents.

![String in Memory|400](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl04-01.svg)<p class="clear"><sup style="font-size: 70%;">Figure 4-1: Representation in memory of a `String` holding the value `"hello"` bound to `s1`</sup></p>

The length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the `String` is currently using. The capacity is the total amount of memory, in bytes, that the `String` has received from the allocator. The difference between length and capacity matters, but for now we'll ignore the capacity.
When we assign `s1` to `s2`, the `String` data is copied, which means we copy the pointer, length and capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the data on the heap that the pointer refers to. The data representation in memory looks like this:

![String in Memory|400](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl04-02.svg)<p class="clear"><sub style="font-size: 70%;">Figure 4-2: Representation in memory of the variable `s2` that has a copy of the pointer, length, and capacity of `s1`</sub></p>

In Figure 4-3 we see what the memory would look like if Rust instead copied the heap data as well. If Rust did this, the operation `s2 = s1` could be very expensive in terms of runtime performance if the data on the heap were large.

![String in Memory|400](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl04-03.svg)<p class="clear"><sup style="font-size: 70%;">Figure 4-3: Another possibility for what `s2 = s1` might do if Rust copied the heap data as well</sup></p>

Earlier, we said that when a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically calls the `drop` function and cleans up the heap memory for that variable. But Figure 4-2 shows both data pointers pointing to the same location. This is a problem: when `s2` and `s1` go out of scope, they will both try to free the same memory. This is known as a *double free* error and is one of the memory safety bugs we mentioned previously. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory corruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. 
To ensure memory safety, there one more detail to what happens in this situation in Rust. After `let s2 = s1`, Rust considers `s1` to no longer be valid. #important Therefore, Rust doesn't need to free anything when `s1` goes out of scope. Check out what happens when you try to use `s1` after `s2` is created; it won't work:
```rust
	let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;

    println!("{}, world!", s1);
```
You'll get an error like this because Rust prevents you from using the invalidated reference: 
```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `s1`
 --> src/main.rs:5:28
  |
2 |     let s1 = String::from("hello");
  |         -- move occurs because `s1` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
3 |     let s2 = s1;
  |              -- value moved here
4 | 
5 |     println!("{}, world!", s1);
  |                            ^^ value borrowed here after move

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0382`.
error: could not compile `ownership` due to previous error
```
If you've heard the terms *shallow copy* and *deep copy* while working with other languages, the concept of copying the pointer, length and capacity without copying the data probably sounds like making a shallow copy. But because Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of being called a shallow copy, it's known as a *move*. In this example, we would say that `s1` was moved into `s2`. So what actually happens is shown in figure 4-4:

![String in Memory|400](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl04-04.svg)<p class="clear"><sub style="font-size: 70%;">Figure 4-4: Representation in memory after `s1` has been invalidated</sub></p>

That solves our problem. With only `s2` valid, when it goes out of scope, it alone will free the memory.
In addition, there's a design choice that is implied by this: Rust will never automatically create "deep" copies of your data. Therefore, any *automatic* copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance. 

### Ways variables and data interact: Clone
If we do want to deeply copy the heap data of the `String`, not just the stack data, we can use a common method called `clone`. Here's an example: 
```rust
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone();

    println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
```
This works just fine and explicitly produces the behavior shown in Figure 4-3, where the heap data *does* get copied. 
When you see a call to `clone`, you know that some arbitrary code is being executed and that code may be expensive. It's a visual indicator that something different is going on. 

### Stack-only data: Copy
There's another wrinkle we haven't talked about yet. This code using integers works and is valid: 
```rust
    let x = 5;
    let y = x;

    println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
```
But this code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don't have a call to `clone`, but `x` is still valid and wasn't moved into `y`.
The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick to make. That means there's no reason we would want to prevent `x` from being valid after we create `y`. In other words, there's no difference between deep and shallow copying here, so calling `clone` wouldn't do anything different from the usual shallow copying and we can leave it out. 
Rust has a special annotation called the `Copy` trait that we can place on types like integers that are stored on the stack. If a type implements the `Copy` trait, an older variable is still usable after assignment. Rust won't let us annotate a type with the `Copy` trait if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the `Drop` trait. If the type needs something special to happen when the value goes out of scope and we add the `Copy` annotation to that type, we'll get a compile-time error. To learn how to add the `Copy` annotation to your type to implement the trait, see "Derivable Traits" in Appendix C.
You should check the documentation for which types implement the trait `Copy`, but as a general rule, any group of similar scalar values can implement `Copy`, and nothing that requires allocation or is some form of recourse can implement `Copy`. Here are some types that implement `Copy`:
- All integer types, such as `u32`.
- The boolean type, `bool`, with values `true` and `false`.
- All floating types, such as `f64`.
- The character type, `char`.
- Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement `Copy`. For example `(i32, i32)` implements `Copy`, but `(i32, String)` does not.

### Ownership and Functions
The semantics for passing a value to a function are similar to those for assigning a value to a variable. Passing a value to a function will move or copy, just as assignment does. Here's an example with some annotations showing where variables go into and out of scope.
```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```
If we tried to call `s` after the call to `takes_ownership`, Rust would throw a compile-time error. These static checks protect us from mistakes. 

### Return Values and Scope
Returning values can also transfer ownership. Here is an example with annotations similar to those as the above code.
```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it

    let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope

    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // moves out to the calling
                                             // function
}

// This function takes a String and returns one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}
```
The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time: assigning a value to another variable always moves it. When a variable that includes data on the heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by `drop` unless the data has been moved to be owned by another variable. 
Taking ownership and then returning ownership with every function is a bit tedious. What if we want to let a function use a value but not take ownership? It's quite annoying that anything we pass in also needs to be passed back if we want to use it again, in addition to any data resulting from the body of the function that we might want to return as well. 
It's possible to return multiple values using a tuple, as shown in this example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s2, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String

    (s, length)
}
```

^40977c

But this is too much ceremony and a lot of work for a concept that should be common. Luckily for us, Rust has a feature for this concept, called *references*.
