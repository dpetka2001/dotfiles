### References and Borrowing
The issue with the tuple code in the previous ==[[2.1 What is Ownership#^40977c|chapter]]== is that we have to return the `String` to the calling function so we can still use the `String` after the call to `calculate_length`, because the `String` was moved into `calculate_length`.
Here is how you would define and use a `calculate_length` function that has a reference to an object as a parameter instead of taking ownership of the value: 
```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { // s is a reference to a String
    s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of what
  // it refers to, nothing happens.
```
First notice that all the tuple code is gone. Second, note that we pass `&s1` into `calculate_length` and, in its definition, we take `&String` rather than `String`. 
These ampersands are *references*, and they allow you to refer to some value without taking ownership of it. See following diagram:

![&String s pointing at String s1|600](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl04-05.svg)<p class="clear"><sub style="font-size: 70%;">Figure 4-5: A diagram of `&String s` pointing at `String s1`</sub></p>

```
Note: The opposite of referencing by using `&` is dereferencing, which is accomplished with the dereference operator, `*`. We'll see more about this later.
```
Let's take a closer look at the code above.
The `&s1` syntax lets us create a reference that refers to the value of `s1` but does not own it. Because it does not own it, the value it points to will not be dropped when the reference stops using it. 
Likewise the signature of the function uses `&` to indicate that the type of the parameter `s` is a reference.
The scope in which the variable `s` is valid is the same as any function parameter's scope, but we don't drop what the reference points to when `s` stops being used because we don't have ownership. When functions have references as parameters instead of the actual values, we won't need to return the values in order to give back ownership, because we never had ownership.
We call the action of creating a reference *borrowing*. 
So what happens if we try to modify something we're borrowing? It doesn't work! See example below:
```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```
Here's the error:
```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)

```
Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references. We're not allowed to modify something we have a reference to. 

### Mutable References
We can fix the error in the above code with a few small tweaks. 
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```
First we had to change `s` to be `mut`. Then we had to create a mutable reference with `&mut s` where we call the `change` function, and update the function signature to accept a mutable reference with `some_string: &mut String`. This makes it very clear that the `change` function will mutate the value it borrows. 
But mutable references have one big restriction: you can have only one mutable reference to a particular piece of data at a time. #important 
This code will fail:
```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s;

    println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
```
with the error:
```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time

6 | 
7 |     println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
  |                        -- first borrow later used here

error: could not compile `ownership` due to previous error
```
This error says that this code is invalid because we cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time. The first mutable borrow is in `r1` and must last until it's used in `println!`, but between the creation of that mutable reference and its usage, we tried to create another mutable reference in `r2` that borrows the same data as `r1`. 
The restriction preventing multiple mutable references to the same data at the same time allows for mutation in a very controlled fashion. 
The benefit of having this restriction is that Rust can prevent data races at compile time. A *data race* is similar to a race condition and happens when these 3 behaviors occur:
- Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
- At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data. 
- There's no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data. 

Data races cause undefined behavior and can be difficult to diagnose and fix when you're trying to track them down at runtime; Rust prevents this problem from happening because it won't even compile code with data races. 
As always, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for multiple mutable references, just not *simultaneous* ones:
```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
    } // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

    let r2 = &mut s;
```
A similar rule exists for combining mutable and immutable references. The following results in error:
```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM

    println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
```
The error is:
```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 --> src/main.rs:6:14

  |              ^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
7 | 
8 |     println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
  |                                -- immutable borrow later used here

```
So, we also cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one. Users of an immutable reference don't expect the values to suddenly change out from under them. However, multiple immmutable references are okay because no one who is just reading the data has the ability to affect anyone else's reading of the data. 
Note that a reference's scope starts from where it is introduced and continues through the last time that reference is used. For instance, this code will compile because the last usage of the immutable references, the `println!`, occurs before the mutable reference is introduced:
```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
    // variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point

    let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
    println!("{}", r3);
```
The scopes of `r1` and `r2` end after the `println!` where they are last used, which is before the mutable reference `r3` is created. These scopes don't overlap, so this code is allowed. #important 
The ability of the compiler to tell that a reference is no longer being used at a point before the end of the scope is called *Non-Lexical Lifetimes* (NLL for short), and you can read more about it in [<font color="yellow">The Edition Guide</font>](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/Rust-1.31-and-rust-2018.html#non-lexical-lifetimes)
Even though borrowing errors may be frustrating at times, remember that it's the Rust's compiler pointing out a potential bug early (at compile time rather than at runtime) and showing you exactly where the problem is.

### Dangling References
In languages with pointers, it's easy to erroneously create a *dangling pointer*, a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been to someone else, by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory. In Rust, by contrast, the compiler guarantees that references will never be dangling references: if you have a reference to some data, the compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the reference to the data does. 
Let's try to create a dangling reference in the following example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String
    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String

    &s // we return a reference to the String, s
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
  // Danger!
```
Here's the error:
```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 --> src/main.rs:5:16

```
This error message refers to a feature we haven't covered yet: lifetimes. We'll discuss this later in another chapter. 
Because `s` is created inside `dangle`, when the code of `dangle` is finished, `s` will be deallocated. But we tried to return a reference to it. That means this reference would be pointing to an invalid `String`. This is no good.
The solution to this is to return the `String` directly:
```rust
fn no_dangle() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    s
}
```
This works without problems. Ownership is moved out, and nothing is deallocated.
