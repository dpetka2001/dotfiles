### The Slice Type
Another data type that does not have ownership is the *slice*. Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection. 
Let's think about how to solve a problem of writing a function that takes a string and returns the first word that finds in the string. If the function doesn't find a space in the string, the whole string must be one word, so the entire string should be returned. 
```rust
fn first_word(s: &String) -> usize {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return i;
        }
    }

    s.len()
}
```
The function `first_word` has a `&String` as a parameter. We don't want ownership, so this is fine. We return the index of the end of the word. 
Because we need to go through the `String` element by element and check whether a value is a space, we'll convert our `String` to an array of bytes using the `as_bytes` method. (We do this because strings in Rust cannot be indexed by default, so we need another way)
Next, we create an iterator over the array of bytes using the `iter` method. 
`iter` is a method that returns each element in a collection and `enumerate` wraps the result of `iter` and returns each element as part of a tuple instead. The first element of the tuple from `enumerate` is the index, and the second element is a reference to the element. 
Because the `enumerate` method returns a tuple, we can use patterns to destructure that tuple. So in the `for` loop, we specify a pattern that has `i` for the index in the tuple and `&item` for the single byte in the tuple. Because we get a reference to the element from `.iter().enumerate()`, we use `&` in the pattern	(because the whole slice we got earlier is a reference to the initial `String`).
In the end we either return the index `i`, which is the position of space in the string, or the whole length of the string if we don't find a space meaning there is only one word.
There is a slight problem with this implementation. We're returning a `usize` on its own, but it's only a meaningful number in the context of the `&String`. Because it's a seperate value from the `String`, there's no guarantee that it will still be valid in the future. 
Consider the following code that makes use of the `first_word` function above:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let word = first_word(&s); // word will get the value 5

    s.clear(); // this empties the String, making it equal to ""

    // word still has the value 5 here, but there's no more string that
    // we could meaningfully use the value 5 with. word is now totally invalid!
}
```
This program compiles without any errors and would also do so if we used `word` after calling `s.clear()`. Because `word` isn't connected to the state of `s` at all, `word` still contains the value `5`. We could use the value `5` with the variable `s` to try to extract the first word out, but that would be a *logical* bug because the contents of `s` have changed since we saved `5` in `word`. 
Having to worry about the index in `word` getting out of sync with the data in `s` is tedious and error prone. Managing these indices is even more brittle if we write a `second_word` function. Its signature would look like this:
```rust
fn second_word(s: &String) -> (usize, usize) {
```
Now we're tracking a starting *and* an ending index, and we have even more values that were calculated from data in a particular state but aren't tied to that state at all. 
Luckily there is another solution in Rust for this problem: string slices.

### String Slices
A *string slice* is a reference to a part of a `String`, and it looks like this:
```rust
    let s = String::from("hello world");

    let hello = &s[0..5];
    let world = &s[6..11];
```
This is similar to taking a reference to the whole `String` but with the extra `[0..5]` bit. Rather than a reference to the entire `String`, it's a reference to a portion of the `String`.
We can create string slices using a range within brackets by specifying `[starting_index..ending_index]`, where `starting_index` is the first position in the slice and `ending_index` is one more than the last position in the slice. Internally, the slice data structure stores the starting position and the length of the slice.

With Rust's `..` range syntax, if you want to start at index 0, you can drop the value before the two periods. The following are equal:
```rust
let s = String::from("hello");

let slice = &s[0..2];
let slice = &s[..2];
```
The same can be said for the last byte of the `String`, if you want it to be included:
```rust
let s = String::from("hello");

let len = s.len();

let slice = &s[3..len];
let slice = &s[3..];
```
You can also drop both values to take the whole `String`:
```rust
let s = String::from("hello");

let len = s.len();

let slice = &s[0..len];
let slice = &s[..];
```
The type that signifies "string slice" is written as `&str`.

#important 
> Note: String slice range indices must occur at valid UTF-8 character boundaries. If you attempt to create a string slice in the middle of a multibyte character, your program will exit with an error. For the purposes of introducing string slices, we are assuming ASCII only in this section; a more thorough discussion of UTF-8 handling is in the [<font color=yellow>“Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings”</font>](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-02-strings.html#storing-utf-8-encoded-text-with-strings) section of Chapter 8.

The function `first_word` in the previous section can be rewritten as following using string slices:
```rust
fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}
```
Using string slices doesn't eliminate the logical problem we had in the previous section when we cleared the string after we got back the value we wanted, but it makes the compiler throw an error and helps us catch such kinds of bugs sooner:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let word = first_word(&s);

    s.clear(); // error!

    println!("the first word is: {}", word);
}
```
Here's the error:
```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable

```
Recall from the borrowing rules that we cannot have an immutable reference to data and at the same time also take a mutable reference to the same data. 

### String Literals are Slices
Recall that we talked about string literals being stored inside the binary. Now that we know about slices, we can properly understand string literals:
```rust
let s = "Hello, world!";
```
The type of `s` here is `&str`: it's a slice pointing to that specific point of the binary. 

#important This is also why string literals are immutable; `&str` is an immutable reference.

### String Slices as Parameters
Knowing that you can take slices of literals and `String` values leads us to one more improvement on `first_word`'s signature.
A more experienced Rustacean would write the signature as following:
```rust
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
```
because it allows us to use the same function on both `&String` and `&str` values. 
If we have a string slice, we can pass that directly. If we have a `String`, we can pass a slice of the `String` or a reference to the `String`. This happens because `&String` implicitly derefs to `&str`. Defining a function to take a string slice instead of a reference to a `String` makes our API more general and useful without losing functionality:
```rust
fn main() {
    let my_string = String::from("hello world");

    // `first_word` works on slices of `String`s, whether partial or whole
    let word = first_word(&my_string[0..6]);
    let word = first_word(&my_string[..]);
    // `first_word` also works on references to `String`s, which are equivalent
    // to whole slices of `String`s
    let word = first_word(&my_string);

    let my_string_literal = "hello world";

    // `first_word` works on slices of string literals, whether partial or whole
    let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[0..6]);
    let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[..]);

    // Because string literals *are* string slices already,
    // this works too, without the slice syntax!
    let word = first_word(my_string_literal);
}
```

### Other Slices
String slices, as you might imagine, are specific to strings. But there's a more general slice type, too.
Consider this array:
```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```
Just as we might refer to a part of a string, we might want to refer to a part of an array. We'd do so like this: 
```rust

let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let slice = &a[1..3];

assert_eq!(slice, &[2, 3]);
```
This slice has the type `&[i32]`. It works the same way as string slices do, by storing a reference to the first element and a length.
